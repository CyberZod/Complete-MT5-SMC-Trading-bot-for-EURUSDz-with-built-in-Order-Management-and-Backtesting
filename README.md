Hey coder,
This repository contains two python scripts
Algorithm.py - This is essentially the "trading algo"
  How it works: It is a pure price action bot that trades liquidity swipes after a break of structure within an established range.
                It utilizes stop orders, one pipette above or below the entry candle, for bullish and bearish ranges respectively.
                Same for stop losses but of course, in the opposite direction.
                Take profit is at the high or low of the range, for bullish and b...you get the idea.

The second script is rrmomentumbacktest.py (I'm not great at naming).
  How it works: This script essentially backtests the algorothm.py bot using historical data

Hope you enjoy it, fellow algo trader. Till next time
